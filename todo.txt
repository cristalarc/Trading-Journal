Remember the process:
	• Follow your roles structure so you can start talking to the correspondent agents.
	• Brain dump about your idea, anything that you think of it and talk it through.
	• Once you have a structured output, create from a Software Engineer agent:
		○ Project requirements doc
		○ Tech stack and packages doc
		○ Schema design doc
		○ Detailed app flow doc
	• For frontend you can use v0
	• After passing docs, ask to create a file structure
You then proceed to ask it to build the frontend, with demo data
