[01/03/2025] V0 Agent and UI Agent:
- V0 Agent provided a table based layout instead of a card based layout.
- UI Agent reccomended:
"If your target audience includes a mix of beginners and advanced users: Choose Layout 2 as it balances user-friendliness and feature scalability.
If your audience is primarily experienced traders: Choose Layout 1 for its efficiency and focus on quick navigation."
- V0 Agent chose Layout 1. Provided the following upgrades to layout with help from user:
-- Added tooltips to the headers that will host information about the column, and also a cog icon that will host settings for the column.
-- Made Timeframe, Direction, Sentiment, and Retrospective columns clickable for Dropdown list.
-- Added behavior for the Journal Entry interface. Created a "edit mode" that allows editing of an entry.When editing an entry, a Save button appears, and clicking on the entry will not exit edit mode.

- Created a mockup for the UI.
1. **Main Layout**: A sidebar for navigation and a header for user actions.
2. **Journal Entry Interface**: A card-based design with inline editing capability, including fields for entry date, ticker, current price, direction, sentiment, and comments.
3. **Multi-Timeframe Perspective**: A tabbed interface in the JournalFilters component to switch between hourly, daily, and weekly views.
4. **Filtering and Navigation**: Filters for ticker, week, sentiment, and retrospective status, along with a search bar in the sidebar.
5. **Retrospective Alerts**: An alert component to notify users of pending retrospectives.
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: A basic layout for displaying performance metrics and charts (for future phases).
