- Implement Trades
-- Handle trades imported which are just the exit trade and is not matched to an open trade.
-- Implement the import module of trades. Auto recognize tags.
-- Add Option identifier. Needs to identify what an option is and tie it to the Stock for reporting.

--- Fix the Strategies section not having the new pending review component
--- Create a list of assgining Setup 1 to Setup, Setup 4 to Return Qualification and so on.

- Implement API 
-- Implement Best Exit
-- Implement API for Journal to fetch price based on inputted Stock

- Implement Notifications 
-- Tell the user that an Idea trigger has been hit for Active ideas.

- Implement Scratchpad
-- Mobile note taking that user can use to quickly capture an opportunity.
-- Notifications should remind user to process these entries.

- Complete the Retrospective functionality and retrospectives view.
- Marge Retrospective with API capabilities
- Implement Reminders with SMS or other high visibility
- Implement Positions and Thesis (modules where I can have my positions and build investment thesis for them)


- Does WOP have a feature to clear all entries automatically? If so, not working
- Implement Thinkorswim import.
- Implement Investment Thesis


Add form validation and submission handling
Implement authentication for user accounts
Add more advanced filtering and search capabilities

Let's make some adjustments to the Setup Tags system when ingesting trades.
Currently, it's made in a way that only "Setup" category trades 

- Remove Ideas expiration component. This is not practical.
Add proper logging

Add automatic calculation of Quality depending on the strategy.


The current structure provides a solid foundation that follows the requirements in the product manager output and can be extended as needed.
Pre-compile the app on opening? Very slow to navigate

- Data Model Design
-- Think through what an entry needs. Status of Retro? Result of Retro?

To add:
---Data check---
//Journal View//
- Ticker typo checker
- Add required fields for entry: confirmed ticker, price, comment.

---UI---
//Journal View//
- Restrospectives tab. Work on making it functional.
- How am I going to handle the Time Table when there's too many entries?
- When clicking on the eye icon, show a panel on the right side that shows the timeline of all comments for all timeframes. See Journal_Entry_On_Click-Sidebar.png
- During journal entries, the dropdowns have a different look than the rest of the page.
- Add a pop-up panel when the user clicks the Complete Retrospective button.
- Add shortcuts to Settings where applicable (Governing Pattern, Timeframe, etc.) when possible.
- Ensure the design adapts smoothly to smaller screen sizes, such as tablets or mobile devices, by stacking elements or enabling collapsible menus.
- Implement lazy loading or pagination for the journal table to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Add easy creation of new Setup attributes in the Journal page.
- Find where to place the retrospective hub. (likely in analytics?)
- When you click on a Ticker in the Journal Table, it efectively works as a filter by Ticker.
- Price is fetched automatically once the ticker is selected. If price can't be fetched, ask user to supply it.
- Check UI versus V0. Change UI to match V0 in terms of notifications and filters.
- Make sure that the Eligible for Weekly One Pager edit works when the component is added.
- ADD THIS TO THE NEW UI. Change the bottom search bar to be able to search in all functions. When you search for a ticker, it shows a table with info from Journal, Weekly One Pager, Trades, etc.

//Settings//
- Improve the Trading Patterns and Timeframes setting page UI.

++Testing++
- Test that the retrospective reminder dissappears when the retrospective is completed.
- Test searching capabilities.
- Test that the notifications icon shows the number of notifications.
- Tooltips show data.

---Database---
- Create a database for Settings. Includes Patterns, Strategies, Timeframes, Tooltips. 
- Add db backuping





---Operations---
//Create a Restrospective Function//
-- Retrospective is its own function with several responsabilities. Have a PM assigned to it.
-- Retrospective can be a process that asks if pattern played ut, if direction or sentiment were right and if the Strategy was followed (for trades, not journal entries).
-- Automation as a setting. You can specify rules that automate the retrospective process, like determining if it was a win or not.
-- Chart analysis of Journal entries. A chart that puts the ticker price performance over time on the background, and overlays your direction and sentiment to determine how right you were.

MVP Implementation (Phase 1):
Focus on core journal entry creation and daily updates. #TODO
Enable basic filtering by ticker and timeframe.
Ensure API integration is functional, with manual fallback for price entry.
--Advanced Features (Phase 2):
Add retrospective fields and reminders.
Enhance the UI with tabbed views and calendar-based filtering.
--Long-Term Enhancements (Phase 3+):
Integrate analytics for sentiment performance.
Enable attachments (e.g., screenshots) to enrich entries.
Develop a recommendation engine for pattern recognition.
--Scalability and Performance:
Use indexing for key fields and lazy loading for large datasets.
Optimize API calls to prevent delays in price fetching.

Remember the process:
	• Follow your roles structure so you can start talking to the correspondent agents.
	• Brain dump about your idea, anything that you think of it and talk it through.
	• Once you have a structured output, create from a Software Engineer agent:
		○ Project requirements doc
		○ Tech stack and packages doc
		○ Schema design doc
		○ Detailed app flow doc
	• For frontend you can use v0
	• After passing docs, ask to create a file structure
You then proceed to ask it to build the frontend, with demo data
