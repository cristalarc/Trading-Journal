- **Game Plan field** in database schema (`gamePlan` column) for storing trading strategies and plans.
- **Quick toggle functionality** in Journal dashboard Actions column to mark entries as eligible for Weekly One Pager.

### Notes
- Weekly One Pager entries are identified by `isWeeklyOnePagerEligible` boolean field.

## [Previous] - Retrospective Feature Overhaul

### Added
- Overdue status (`overdue`) to the `RetroStatus` enum in the Prisma schema and database.
- Backend logic to automatically update 7D and 30D retrospectives to `overdue` when their respective time periods have passed and the status is still `pending`.
- Toast notifications for user feedback when completing a retrospective.

### Changed
- Retrospectives page now only displays entries with `overdue` status for 7D or 30D retrospectives (not `pending`).
- Journal table now visually distinguishes between `Pending` (yellow), `Overdue` (amber/orange), `Win` (green), and `Loss` (red) tags.
- Backend logic for updating overdue status now updates 7D and 30D independently, preventing both from being set to `overdue` unless both are actually overdue.
- Only retrospectives with `overdue` status are counted for the "Retrospective Action Required" warning and shown for user action.

### Fixed
- Bug where both 7D and 30D retrospectives were marked as `overdue` even if only one was actually overdue.
- Bug where the UI would show `Loss` for overdue or new entries instead of the correct tag.
- Bug where the Retrospectives page would not show Win/Loss buttons for overdue retrospectives.
- Bug where the color for `Overdue` and `Loss` tags was the same; now `Overdue` is amber/orange and `Loss` is red.

### Notes
- Prisma Client must be regenerated after schema changes (`npx prisma generate`).
- Only retrospectives with `overdue` status require user action and are shown in the Retrospectives page.
