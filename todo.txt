Enable basic filtering by ticker and timeframe.
Ensure API integration is functional, with manual fallback for price entry.
--Advanced Features (Phase 2):
Add retrospective fields and reminders.
Enhance the UI with tabbed views and calendar-based filtering.
--Long-Term Enhancements (Phase 3+):
Integrate analytics for sentiment performance.
Enable attachments (e.g., screenshots) to enrich entries.
Develop a recommendation engine for pattern recognition.
--Scalability and Performance:
Use indexing for key fields and lazy loading for large datasets.

Remember the process:
	• Follow your roles structure so you can start talking to the correspondent agents.
	• Brain dump about your idea, anything that you think of it and talk it through.
	• Once you have a structured output, create:
		○ Project requirements doc
		○ Tech stack and packages doc
		○ Schema design doc
		○ Detailed app flow doc
	• For frontend you can use v0
	• After passing docs, ask to create a file structure
You then proceed to ask it to build the frontend, with demo data
