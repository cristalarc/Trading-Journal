- Created the Settings page.
- Created the Sidepanel and Time Table. A panel that shows the timeline of all comments for all timeframes of an specific stock.
New UI Feature: Sidepanel with Time Table
Overview
When a user clicks the eye icon on any row in the Journal Entries table, a Sidepanel will slide in from the right side of the screen.
The Sidepanel will be full height and half the width of the screen.
Its purpose is to display a Time Table that aggregates all comments related to that stock for a specific week.
Time Table Structure
The Time Table inside the Sidepanel will have three columns, each displaying comments grouped by timeframe:

Left Column (Weekly Comments)

This column shows all comments from Weekly timeframe entries for the selected stock in the chosen week.
These are higher-level insights or summaries for the week.
Middle Column (Daily Comments)

This column contains all Daily timeframe comments for the same stock and week.
Since there can be up to 5 daily comments in a week, they should be stacked vertically.
Right Column (Hourly Comments)

This column displays Hourly timeframe comments, stacked similarly.
There can be multiple comments per day, so the list may be longer.
Behavior & Interaction
Expandable Cards: Each comment should be inside a clickable card, allowing users to expand them for better readability.
Navigation: The user should be able to scroll within each column independently.
Visual Hierarchy: Weekly comments should be larger/more prominent, while Daily and Hourly should be more compact.

[01/06/2025] V0 Agent:
- Changed behavior of the edit button to open a card that takes focus of the screen. Same behavior applied for Add New Entry.
- Added a new Save Changes button to the entry dropdown in the Journal View table.
- Submitting to UI Designer Agent for feedback.

UI Agent:
- Bell button on the top right corner now shows the number of notifications.
- Bottom left search bar should search in all functions (Journal, Weekly One Pager, Trades).
- Add a reset button to reset all filters in one click.
- Implement lazy loading or pagination for the journal table to hanle large datasets efficiently.

[01/03/2025] V0 Agent and UI Agent:
- V0 Agent provided a table based layout instead of a card based layout.
- UI Agent reccomended:
"If your target audience includes a mix of beginners and advanced users: Choose Layout 2 as it balances user-friendliness and feature scalability.
If your audience is primarily experienced traders: Choose Layout 1 for its efficiency and focus on quick navigation."
- V0 Agent chose Layout 1. Provided the following upgrades to layout with help from user:
-- Added tooltips to the headers that will host information about the column, and also a cog icon that will host settings for the column.
-- Made Timeframe, Direction, Sentiment, and Retrospective columns clickable for Dropdown list.
-- Added behavior for the Journal Entry interface. Created a "edit mode" that allows editing of an entry.When editing an entry, a Save button appears, and clicking on the entry will not exit edit mode.

[01/02/2025] V0 Agent:
- Created a mockup for the UI.
1. **Main Layout**: A sidebar for navigation and a header for user actions.
2. **Journal Entry Interface**: A card-based design with inline editing capability, including fields for entry date, ticker, current price, direction, sentiment, and comments.
3. **Multi-Timeframe Perspective**: A tabbed interface in the JournalFilters component to switch between hourly, daily, and weekly views.
4. **Filtering and Navigation**: Filters for ticker, week, sentiment, and retrospective status, along with a search bar in the sidebar.
5. **Retrospective Alerts**: An alert component to notify users of pending retrospectives.
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: A basic layout for displaying performance metrics and charts (for future phases).
